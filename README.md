# Music Emotion Analysis Using Audio Features

## Overview
This project explores the relationship between audio features and the emotions conveyed by music. By analyzing songs using features like MFCCs, chroma, and tempo, the goal is to determine if certain musical characteristics correlate with specific emotions (e.g., happy, sad).

## Motivation
I have a passion for both music and data science. This project allows me to merge these interests by applying data science techniques to understand how musical elements contribute to emotional perception.

## Data Sources and Collection
- **Data Source:** Public domain songs and manually curated song list with known emotional labels. Additionally, I will add short song examples composed and recorded by myself to add more variation to the data ( I will regularly compose and record music for more data)
- **Collection Method:** Audio files (WAV/MP3) will be processed using Librosa to extract relevant features. General timbre of the sound, audial properties and the tonal/harmonic relations will be extracted via Libraso and manually by me if needed.
